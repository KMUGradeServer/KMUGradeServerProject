# 2015 Capstone Project 
#### @Kookmin Univ.
### Project : KMU Grade Server
### Team : Attention Seeker (No14)
KMU Grade Server is a Web code judging service for everybody who want to practice coding.
You can choose a problem that you want to solve and you can see the result directly.

For a school or an association, users can be managed as a group so it's easier to overview their activities.

Our first milestone(~2015.5) is to service for about 2K people and handle 1K of judging request.

Overall coding is written with [python flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)<br>
And used followings<br>
[python tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable) for Web access,<br>
[redis](http://www.redis.io) for Judging server,<br>
[docker](http://www.docker.com) for handling each request of judging,<br>
[mariadb](https://mariadb.org/), [sqlalchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for database access.

We are pleasure you to contribute for this project anytime!
